# Project progress

Last updated: 2026-08-30 (Asia/Shanghai)

## Research

Status: `DONE`

- Repository inspected: initialized empty Git repository on `main`; no commit and no remote at inspection time.
- Primary-source studies cover Mem0, Letta/LangGraph, Zep/Graphiti, frameworks, and three memory benchmarks.
- Mem0, Letta, LangGraph, and Graphiti source paths are pinned to full commit SHAs with call-chain audits.
- The evidence-graded competitive matrix and cross-system design lessons are complete.
- Initial Phase 1 snapshot `183d876` was pushed to `origin/main`; remote publication is verified.

## Architecture

Status: `DONE` for Phase 1 design; ADRs 0001–0004 remain `PROPOSED`, ADR-0005 is `ACCEPTED`

- Problem definition, three candidates, trade-offs, and recommendation are documented.
- Proposed direction: Java modular monolith + durable outbox/projection workers + PostgreSQL/pgvector/FTS.
- Assertion versions and state transitions are append-only while retained; governed erasure is an explicit exception.

## MVP

Status: `DOING` — Feature 5 is `DONE / PUBLISHED`; Feature 6 is next

- Phase 1 was reviewed and the active project goal authorizes Features 0–6.
- Feature 0 engineering foundation is `DONE`: local Maven/Testcontainers, pgvector migration, architecture, Python, documentation, and API/worker smoke gates passed. The workflow is published and exercised by green GitHub Actions run `#17`.
- Feature 1 is `DONE` and published: source-event receipt and outbox commit atomically; claim/lease/fencing/retry/dead/replay and a payload-free logical-effect ledger passed PostgreSQL fault/concurrency tests and runtime smoke.
- Feature 2 is `DONE` and published in `6292b150851218fe6ab480115bde24a214b4d411`: provider-neutral strict extraction, deterministic trust/sensitivity/write policy, sanitized candidate/quarantine persistence, lease-fenced atomic completion, optional real-provider adapter, 17-case conformance fixture, and runtime smoke passed.
- Feature 3 is `DONE` and published in `5ff32fda451f3923e4130e309e5c19167e84905d`: versioned temporal authority, deterministic transition semantics, correction/invalidation, scoped APIs, 14-case temporal conformance, PostgreSQL fault/concurrency coverage, and API→worker→database restart smoke passed.
- Feature 4 is `DONE / PUBLISHED` through `69c5f63e836160aab04fc9995259f9c87aa2ca3e`: rebuildable vector/FTS projections, transition-watermarked projection jobs, scoped hybrid RRF retrieval, reranker fallback, trace restriction, evidence-budgeted context, and a six-case deterministic conformance fixture are implemented. GitHub Actions run `#17` passed JVM/PostgreSQL, Python, docs, and the full Feature 0–4 compose smoke, including governed invalidation, zero-row projection cleanup, and worker restart.
- Feature 5 is `DONE / PUBLISHED` through `ae377143929cf2a7fcfbfccae21d8792b7275d7e`:
  verified JWT scope, `USER`/`OPERATOR`/`PRIVACY_ADMIN` boundaries, content-safe errors and trace
  audit, memory/user deletion operations, immediate projection hiding, lease-fenced atomic erasure,
  retry/dead/privacy-admin requeue, opaque append-only tombstones, replay/resurrection guards, and
  a four-case hostile-memory rendering fixture are implemented. GitHub Actions
  [run #22](https://github.com/Zhi-Xiang-Guo/memos/actions/runs/33272314267) passed Java 25,
  PostgreSQL migration/fault/concurrency tests, Python, docs, and the full Feature 0–5 compose
  smoke. This is implementation evidence, not formal security effectiveness or model-quality data.

## Advanced Memory

Status: `TODO`

- Temporal conflict semantics, forgetting, pollution control, and optional graph projections require MVP evidence.

## Benchmark

Status: `TODO` for execution; research/protocol `DONE`

- LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and BEAM research plus the experiment protocol are complete.
- No experiment has run; [results](benchmark/results.md) intentionally contain no scores.

## Optimization

Status: `TODO`

## Resume

Status: `TODO`

- No performance numbers will be written before benchmark completion.

## Interview

Status: `TODO`

## Phase-1 exit criteria

- [x] Eight required research documents complete and source-linked.
- [x] Critical Mem0, Letta, LangGraph, and Zep source paths pinned to commit SHAs.
- [x] Competitive matrix separates confirmed capability from inference.
- [x] Problem definition, architecture candidates, trade-offs, and recommendation complete.
- [x] MVP scope, benchmark plan, open questions, and next phase gate complete.
- [x] Documentation link check and unsupported-claim audit pass.
- [x] Initial commit pushed to a GitHub remote.

## Decision log snapshot

| Topic | Current decision | Fact grade | Evidence / follow-up |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Phase boundary | MVP Features 0–6 are authorized under one continuous goal | `CONFIRMED` | Active project goal |
| System of record | PostgreSQL; vector/FTS indexes are projections | `HYPOTHESIS` | Validate in MVP benchmark |
| Topology | Modular monolith plus asynchronous worker/outbox | `HYPOTHESIS` | Failure-recovery spike in MVP |
| Retrieval | Hybrid candidate generation and measured fusion | `HYPOTHESIS` | Tune only on benchmark dev split |
| Graph database | Not in MVP | `HYPOTHESIS` | Add only if entity/multi-hop ablation proves value |
| Benchmark scores | None available | `CONFIRMED` | No run has been executed |

## Next phase

Start Feature 6 reproducible evaluation without entering Advanced Memory: freeze the representative
workload, dataset/license boundary, model snapshots, baseline parity, and immutable run manifest
before executing the smoke campaign. The legacy trusted scope headers and temporary operator key
are removed and must not be reintroduced.
